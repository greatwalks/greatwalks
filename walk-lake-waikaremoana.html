      Trace the shores of the beautiful Lake
      Waikaremoana, the &ldquo;sea of rippling waters&rdquo;. Get a
      glimpse of how New Zealand used to be: explore the prehistoric rainforests, marvel
      at the giant podocarps, visit remote beaches and deepen your imagination with this
      Great Walk&rsquo;s rich spiritual and cultural history. Te Urewera
      National Park is the home of Ng&#257;i
      T&#363;hoe. It also offers access to some of New Zealand&rsquo;s most
      iconic birds, including Kiwi, Kerer&#363;

      <li>
        Walk the track counter-clockwise. This way you hit the Panekire Bluff, the
        biggest climb of the walk, when your pack will be lightest and your muscles will
        be all warmed up and used to the exercise.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Korokoro Falls are well worth the detour. This spectacular waterfall
        drops off a sheer cliff amidst native rain forest - very instagrammable!
        It&rsquo;s a 30 minute walk just before the suspension bridge.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take your swimming gear! The cool, crystal clear water will be superbly
        refreshing after a long day&rsquo;s walk. There are plenty of spots, and most of
        the huts and campsites have great swimming too.
      </li>
      <li>
        Climbing to 1185 m to Panekire Hut you&rsquo;ll be rewarded with views of
        the ocean and the lake. Watch the sunrise through the goblin forest trees at the
        top.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the weather is less than postcard-blue skies, remember that the remote
        Te Urewera National Park has been home to the Ng&#257;i T&#363;hoe, the local
        M&#257;ori people, who call themselves Nga Tamariki o te Kohu - the children of the
        mist. If you&rsquo;re spending a rainy evening by the hut fireside, why not take
        a guidebook and make the most of the opportunity to learn the names of some
        plants or birds in Te Reo M&#257;ori?

        Napier - 180km / 112mi , 2 hours

      <li>
        Rotorua - 150km / 93mi , 3 hours 30 min (note:
        the driving time is longer from Rotorua as the road (State Highway 38) is
        unsealed for approximately 90km / 56mi  from Murupara to Aniwaniwa.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
      Flights to any of these airports typically connect from Auckland or
      Wellington. The above driving times are indicative only - always allow for extra
      time to get to your destination.
    </p>
    
    <h4>
      How to get to the
      trailhead
    </h4>
    <p>
      The track can be accessed by car or you can arrange shuttle transport through
      a tour operator.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Note: the track is located deep inside Te Urewera National Park, so access to
      the trailhead is at least partially on windy, narrow, and unsealed roads through
      the rainforest. The scenery is beautiful - just don&rsquo;t forget that your drive
      to the trailhead will take considerably longer than on regular roads. Also, note
      that for much of the Te Urewera Rainforest Route there is no cell phone
      reception.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You can start your walk either from Onepoto or Hopuruahine along the Te
      Urewera Rainforest Route (SH38). Both trailheads can also be accessed by water taxi
      from the Waikaremoana Motor Camp, Aniwaniwa, which has secure car parking and a DOC
      visitor centre close by.

      Track description
    </h4>
    <p>
      Lake Waikaremoana can be walked in either direction. This guide describes a
      clockwise route from Onepoto to Hopuruahine - however many people
      prefer walking the track counter-clockwise.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There are a number of transport providers to assist you with pickups and
      dropoffs, either by road or water taxi. Please visit your friendly team at
      the Te Urewera National Park Visitor Centre or check

      Elevation profile
    </h4>
    <p>
      This track has one longer climb up the Panekire Bluff, where you first ascend
      then descend about 600 m / 1,970 f. Aside from this, there are only moderate
      elevation changes. Note the altitude level when you view
      the elevation profile!

      Day 1: Onepoto to Panekire Hut
    </p>
    <p>
      4-6 hours, 9km / 6mi 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the most strenuous part of the trip.  The views from Panekire
      make it really worthwhile. The track starts from the Onepoto Shelter through the
      former Armed Constabulary Redoubt and climbs steadily up to the top of Panekire
      Bluff. It then follows the undulating ridgeline before reaching Puketapu Trig (1180
      m / 3871 ft) and onto Panekire Hut.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Day 2: Panekire Hut to Waiopaoa Hut
    </p>
    <p>
      3-4 hours, 8km / 5mi 
    </p>
    <p>
      From Panekire Hut, the track heads south-west down the range to the top of
      the Panekire descent. From here the track drops steeply off the range into rolling
      valleys of beech, podocarp and k&#257;mahi forest
      and the lake. The Waiopaoa Hut makes a good stopping point for lunch. Have a
      relaxing afternoon and take the short walk up the side track from the Korokoro
      Campsite to the must-see waterfalls (2 hours return.)
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Day 3: Waiopaoa Hut to Marauiti Hut
    </p>
    <p>
      4-5 hours, 12km / 7mi 
    </p>
    <p>
      Day 3 sees the track head up the Waiopoa Stream a short distance before
      crossing grassy flats and heading through
      k&#257;nuka forest on the lake shore. The undulating track
      weaves up and over a number of small ridges, through young rimu
      wooded areas and along the lake edge. You can either stay at Marauiti, or
      push through to Waiharuru Hut - this is a great spot to stop for the night - at
      dusk go for a walk to the edge of Puketukutuku Peninsula
      where you may hear the call of the kiwi.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Day 4: Marauiti Hut to Hopuruahine
    </p>
    <p>
      4-5 hours, 11km / 7mi 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is another moderate day of walking with plenty of fantastic photo
      opportunities. The track ends with a classic New Zealand suspension bridge.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Fantastic side trip
    </p>
    <p>
      Spend an extra day at Waikaremoana and take a stroll up the hill from Te
      Urewera National Park Visitor Centre to explore another amazing lake - Lake
      Waikareiti. Hire a boat from the Visitor Centre at Aniwaniwa before departing to
      Lake Waikareiti and spend some time on the water.  Or row out to Rahui Island
      where you can take another short walk to enjoy the views of Lake Te
      Tamaiti-o-Waikaremoana. It&rsquo;s a lake on an island in a lake!
