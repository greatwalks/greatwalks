  <h1>Milford Track</h1>

  <p>53.5km / 20.7mi </p>

  <p>4 days</p>

  <p>Experience the stunning grandeur of the Milford Track in beautiful
  Fiordland National Park.</p>

  <p>You'll be awed by natural wonders while walking in a
  spectacular, wild and beautiful part of New Zealand. There are sheer ice-carved valleys
  from a mountain pass, refreshing mountain rivers, peaceful forests and cascading
  waterfalls.</p>
 
  
    <h2>Don&rsquo;t miss</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Cross the Clinton River on this impressive 72 m suspension
    bridge, built by Fijian engineers in 1978. The bridge is a great place to spot eels
    and trout in the river.</li>

    <li>Fiordland National Park is renowned for its high annual
    rainfall but don&rsquo;t despair! The rain provides a mystical moss-draped forest,
    energetic streams and rivers, and waterfalls that are even more
    spectacular!</li>

    <li>Look out for Whio (blue duck) riding rapids on the Clinton
    and Arthur Rivers. Often hard to spot, their blue-grey feathers provide perfect
    camouflage amongst rocks. Males whistle a call of &lsquo;fee-o&rsquo; while females
    make a low rattling sound.</li>

    <li>Follow in the footsteps of early explorer Quintin McKinnon
    who discovered the route, now famously known as the Milford Track, from Lake Te Anau
    to Milford Sound in 1888.</li>

    <li>Spectacular Sutherland Falls drops 580 m in three leaps from
    Lake Quill. Leave your pack at the shelter but don&rsquo;t forget to take your
    raincoat &ndash; the falls generate a lot of spray! Allow 1.5 hours for the return
    trip.</li>

  <h2>Before you  go</h2>

  <p>It is important to plan
  and prepare so that you are well equipped to enjoy your Great Walk.</p>

  

  <p>Before you go, know The Outdoor Safety Code - 5 simple rules to help you stay
  safe:</p>

  

  <ol class="c21" start="1">
    <li>Plan your trip</li>

    <li>Tell someone</li>

    <li>Be aware of the weather</li>

    <li>Know your limits</li>

    <li>Take sufficient supplies</li>
  </ol>

  <h4><a name="h.xf25ghgdn3f4" id="h.xf25ghgdn3f4"></a>Milford
  Track safety</h4>

  <ol>
    <li>
      The track may need to be
      closed for safety reasons (e.g. avalanche danger, flooding or high winds).
      The Fiordland National Park Visitor Centre staff can
      keep you informed of all issues and options around these situations.
    </li>

    <li>
      This track is not
      recommended for children under the age of 10 due to the exposed mountainous
      environment and often adverse weather conditions.
    </li>

    <li>
      During the off-peak
      season (May to October) the track remains open but is subject to weather, track and
      avalanche conditions. Make sure you are fully prepared before you go. DOC rangers
      are not in residence at the huts during the off-peak season.
    </li>

    <li>
      Fiordland National Park
      lies in an area of predominantly westerly airstreams, which deliver high rainfall
      and changeable weather patterns to the area. Cold temperatures, snow, strong winds
      and heavy rain can occur at any time of the year.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <ol>
    <li>Cell phone coverage on the track is limited.</li>
  </ol>

  

  <h4>Things to know
  before you go</h4>

  <ol>
    <li>
      A good level of fitness
      and the right outdoor clothing and equipment will greatly improve the enjoyment of
      your trip.
    </li>

    <li>
      Safety is your
      responsibility - leave your trip details with a trusted contact. Intention forms
      are available at <a href="http://adventuresmart.org.nz/Outdoors-Intentions/Default.asp">adventuresmart.org.nz</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
      Book your trip well in
      advance including your accommodation, transport and transfers to the start/end of
      the Great Walk.
    </li>

    <li>
      Pack all necessary
      equipment, your own food and drinks and any personal items for your trip including
      an extra day's supply of food and water.
    </li>

  <p>Glade Wharf to Clinton Hut</p>

  <p>1-1.5 hours, 5km / 3mi  / 3 mi</p>

  <p>Head to the wharf at Te Anau downs for a leisurely 1 hour 25 minute
  cruise across the lake to the start of the Milford Track. 1km into your walk, you will
  come across the first and largest of several suspension bridges along the track. The
  well-graded track goes through beautiful beach forest and along the banks of the
  Clinton River. A short 10 minute side track just before the Clinton Hut, leads to a
  wetland area. There are great swimming holes near the hut.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Clinton Hut to Mintaro Hut</p>

  <p>6 hours, 16.5km / 6.4mi  / 10 mi</p>

  <p>Following the Clinton River, you gradually climb towards its source
  Lake Mintaro at the base of Mackinnon Pass. Admire the lush forest as you head towards
  Clinton Forks &ndash; a prime spot for seeing the endangered whio (blue duck). Past the
  Hirere Falls, you get a first view of the Mackinnon Pass and the impressive Pompolona
  ice field. From here, you can take in the sheer scale of the rock walls towering above
  and notice the vegetation change as you reach higher altitudes.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Mintaro Hut to Dumpling Hut</p>

  <p>6-7 hours, 14km / 9mi  / 8 mi</p>

  <p>A zigzag climb leads to Mackinnon Pass and the memorial to Quintin
  Mackinnon which has inspiring views of Lake Mintaro and the Clinton Canyon. The track
  from here drops steadily, through an alpine garden and several waterfalls before
  arriving at the Bus Stop Shelter at Marlene&rsquo;s Creek and the Sutherland Falls side
  track. Here you can opt to leave your pack at the shelter and take the track up to the
  magnificent Sutherland Falls, the highest in New Zealand. Allow an extra 1.5 hours walk
  time return.</p>

  

  <p> </p>

  <p>Dumpling Hut to Sandfly Point</p>

  <p>5.5-6 hours, 18km / 11mi  / 11 mi</p>

  <p>Follow the Arthur River to the historic boatshed, the impressive
  Mackay Falls and intriguing Bell Rock. Admire the rock cuttings alongside the Arthur
  River and Lake Ada, which were blasted and hand cut by contracted labourers. The final
  3km / 2mi  of the walk is an enjoyable, smooth, wide track constructed by a prison labour
  gang in the early 1890s. Pass the Giant Gate Falls before you take the short boat ride
  back to Te Anau.</p>
