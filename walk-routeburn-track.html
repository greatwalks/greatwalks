      It is important to plan and prepare
      so that you are well equipped to enjoy your Great Walk.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Before you go, know <strong>The Outdoor Safety Code</strong> - 5 simple rules to help you stay
      safe:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        Plan your trip
      </li>
      <li>
        Tell someone
      </li>
      <li>
        Be aware of the weather
      </li>
      <li>
        Know your limits
      </li>
      <li>
        Take sufficient supplies
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
      Routeburn Track safety
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        
          The track may need to be
          closed for safety reasons (e.g. avalanche danger, flooding or high winds).
          The <a href=
          "http://www.doc.govt.nz/footer-links/contact-us/office-by-name/?mode=details&amp;office=1406">Fiordland
          National Park Visitor Centre</a> staff can keep you informed
          of all issues and options around these situations.
        
      </li>
      <li>
        
          This track is not
          recommended for children under the age of 10 due to the exposed mountainous
          environment and often adverse weather conditions. However, an overnight stay at
          Routeburn Flats, Routeburn Falls or Lake Howden huts is a great way for a
          family to experience part of the track.
        
      </li>
      <li>
        
          During the off-peak
          season (May - October) the track remains open but is subject to weather, track
          and avalanche conditions. Make sure you are fully prepared before you go. There
          are no DOC rangers in residence during the off-peak season.
        
      </li>
      <li>
        Fiordland and Mount
          Aspiring National Parks lies in an area of predominantly westerly airstreams,
          which delivers high rainfall and changeable weather patterns to the area. Cold
          temperatures, snow, strong winds and heavy rain can occur at any time of the
          year.
        
      </li>
      <li>
        Cell phone coverage on the track is limited.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>
      Things to know before you
      go
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        
          A good level of fitness
          and the right outdoor clothing and equipment will greatly improve the enjoyment
          of your trip.
        
      </li>
      <li>
        
          Safety is your
          responsibility - leave your trip details with a trusted contact. Intention
          forms are available at <a href="http://adventuresmart.org.nz/Outdoors-Intentions/Default.asp">adventuresmart.org.nz</a>.
        
      </li>
      <li>
        
          Book your trip well in
          advance including your accommodation, transport and transfers to the start/end
          of the Great Walk.
        
      </li>
      <li>
        
          Pack all necessary
          equipment, your own food and drinks and any personal items for your trip
          including an extra day's supply of food and water.
        
      </li>

    </ul>
    <h3>
      When to go
    </h3>
    <p>
      The best time to walk the Routeburn Track is from late October to late April when the weather is warmer and there are more
      regular transport services to and from the start and end of the track. During the
      off-peak season (May to October) the Routeburn Track remains open but is subject to
      weather, track and avalanche conditions.
    </p>

 Travelling with
      children
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Routeburn Track is the perfect track for you, and your family and
      friends, if you love being amongst nature and want an exciting outdoors adventure
      on a track with excellent facilities. It also offers fantastic day walk
      opportunities for families or those with less time. However, the track is not
      recommended for children under the age of 10 due to the exposed mountainous
      environment and often adverse weather conditions. An excellent option for families
      keen to experience part of the track is an overnight stay at Routeburn Flats Hut,
      Routeburn Falls Hut or Lake Howden Hut.

      Track description
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Routeburn Track can be walked in either direction. This guide describes
      an east to west direction, starting the track at the Routeburn Shelter and ending
      the track at The Divide - the beginning and end of the track are 350km / 217mi
      apart by road. Return transport can be pre-arranged to reach either end of the
      track from nearby towns.

    <p>
      The Routeburn Track's highest point is Harris Saddle (1255m / 4117ft) and the lowest
      point is the Routeburn Shelter (start or finish point of the track) at 458m / 1503ft. At
      532m / 1745ft, The Divide (start or finish point of the track) is at a similar altitude, so
      it&rsquo;s often best to start your walk from the Routeburn Shelter so that the
      first part of your walk is uphill, which means you&rsquo;ll get to enjoy going
      downhill on the last part of your walk! Note the altitude level when you view the
      elevation profile.

    <h3>Walking guide</h3>
    
    <h4>
      Routeburn Shelter to Routeburn Flats Hut
    </h4>
    <p><strong>
      1.5-2.5 hours, 6.5km / 2.5mi</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This journey begins at Routeburn Shelter, with a swing bridge crossing to a
      well-formed track that gently winds beside the crystal clear Route Burn. After
      passing Sugarloaf Stream, the track climbs to Bridal Veil Waterfall and continues
      above the gorge. A swing bridge leads to open, grassed flats and the Routeburn
      Flats Hut and Campsite.
    </p>
    
    <h4>
Routeburn Flats Hut to Routeburn Falls Hut
    </h4>
    <p><strong>
1-1.5 hours, 2.3km / 0.9mi</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      From Routeburn Flats Hut, the track climbs steadily through stunning beech
      forest to Routeburn Falls Hut, situated on the edge of the bush line and close to
      the impressive Route Burn Falls cascade. Along the way, a recent slip provides an
      opportunity for views of the Routeburn Flats and the peaks of the Humboldt
      Mountains. Take care while crossing the slip, especially after heavy rains.
    </p>
    
    <h4>
Routeburn Falls Hut to Lake Mackenzie Hut
    </h4>
    <p><strong>
4.5-6 hours, 11.3km / 4.4mi</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Venture above the bush line and walk amidst the rugged sub-alpine landscape.
      Climb steadily up the valley, through wetlands and tussock-covered flats, before
      sidling along the bluffs above Lake Harris to reach the highest point on the track
      at Tarahaka Whakatipu / Harris Saddle (1255 m). Here a short, steep climb up
      Conical Hill gives superb views of the Hollyford Valley through to Whakatipu Waitai
      / Lake McKerrow, Martins Bay and the Tasman Sea. Allow 1 - 2 hours for the
      return trip back to Harris Saddle. From the saddle, the Routeburn Track descends
      and traverses along the exposed Hollyford Face, with expansive views over the
      Darran Mountains and beyond to the Tasman Sea. This section of the track is well
      known for its impressive array of alpine plants. A steady descent leads to the
      enchanting Lake Mackenzie. A short distance around the lake is Lake Mackenzie Hut
      and Campsite.
    </p>
    
    <h4>
Mackenzie Hut to Howden Hut
    </h4>
    <p><strong>
3-4 hours, 8.6km / 3.3mi</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving Lake Mackenzie Hut, the track crosses a small flat before climbing to
      the bush line. A gradual descent then leads past the &lsquo;Orchard&rsquo;, an open
      grassy area dotted with ribbonwood trees, to the impressive Earland Falls (174 m).
      The track continues its gradual descent through beech forest to Lake Howden
      Hut.
    </p>
    
    <h4>
Lake Howden Hut to The Divide
    </h4>
    <p><strong>
1-1.5 hours, 3.4km / 1.3mi</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The track steadily climbs to meet with the Key Summit Track. Well worth the
      effort, the side trip to Key Summit heads above the bush line and meanders through
      an attractive alpine wetland. You will be rewarded with magnificent views of the
      Darran Mountains, Lake Marian and the Hollyford Valley. From the junction of
      the two tracks, the gradual downhill walk to The Divide is through charming silver
      beech forest.
