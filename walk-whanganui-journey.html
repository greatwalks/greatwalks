      The Whanganui River winds its way from the mountains to the Tasman Sea

      kayak trip to experience its most remote scenic beauty, history and cultural
      significance. <a href="#" class="icon icon-culture" data-content="Learn about the intimate connection the Whanganui iwi share with their awa (river) and imagine the times when traditional waka (canoe) and steam-driven riverboats plied the river.<br>Early M&#257;ori cultivated the sheltered terraces and built elaborate eel weirs along river channels where eels and lamprey were known to converge. Every bend of the river had kaitiaki (guardian) which controlled the mauri (life force) of that place. The mana (prestige) of a settlement depended upon the way in which food supplies and living areas were looked after for the benefit of the tribe."></a>

     <p>
      Before you go, know <strong>The Outdoor Safety Code</strong> - 5 simple rules to help you stay
      safe:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        Plan your trip
      </li>
      <li>
        Tell someone
      </li>
      <li>
        Be aware of the weather
      </li>
      <li>
        Know your limits
      </li>
      <li>
        Take sufficient supplies
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
      Whanganui Journey safety
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Heavy rain and flooding can occur at any time of year on the Whanganui
        River and the weather can change quickly, so you&rsquo;ll need to be prepared for
        rain, cold and windy conditions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don&rsquo;t canoe the river when water levels are predicted to rise or
        it&rsquo;s in flood. If you capsize you may not be able to get back in, or swim
        to the river&rsquo;s edge.
      </li>
      <li>
        Always pull your canoe up high on the bank and tie it to something secure.
        It may not be raining on the river, but rain elsewhere in the large catchment can
        cause the river to rise several metres overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cell phone coverage on the Whanganui Journey is limited.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>
      Things to know before you
      go
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        
          A good level of fitness
          and the right outdoor clothing and equipment will greatly improve the enjoyment
          of your trip.
        
      </li>
      <li>
          Safety is your
          responsibility - Cell phone coverage is limited and it is recommended that you
          leave your trip details with a trusted contact. Intention forms are available
          at <a 
          href=
          "http://adventuresmart.org.nz/Outdoors-Intentions/Default.asp">adventuresmart.org.nz</a>.
        
      </li>
      <li>
          Book your trip well in
          advance including your accommodation, transport and transfers to the start/end
          of the Whanganui Journey.
        </h3>
      </li>
      <li>
        
          Pack all necessary
          equipment, your own food, drinks and any personal items for your trip including
          an extra day's supply of food and water.

    <h3>
      When to go
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Whanganui Journey can be completed at any time of the year, however the
      most popular time to paddle down the river is during the summer months (December -
      February) when the weather is warmer and the days are longer. There are also many
      other recreational opportunities available in Whanganui National Park to enjoy
      including swimming, rafting, camping and fishing.
    </p>

      Travelling with
      children
    </h3>
    <p>
Although the Whanganui Journey is suitable for beginners the trip is not recommended for 
children under 12. The river can fill up rapidly if the weather changes and a good level of 
fitness and the ability to make sound decisions around health and safety are often required.

    <p>
  Wanganui and Taupo Airports are about the same driving distance from the start of the 
  shorter 3 day river journey in <a href="#Whakahoro" data-audio="audio/speech-whakahoro.mp3" class="audio">Whakahoro</a>, approximately 2.5 hours. Canoe hire, 
  drop off and secure parking are packaged together by tour operators. 
  Some tour operators are based along the Whanganui River Road in <a href="#Pipiriki" data-audio="audio/speech-pipiriki.mp3" class="audio">Pipiriki</a>, <a href="#Raetihi" data-audio="audio/speech-raetihi.mp3" class="audio">Raetihi</a> and 
  Ohakune and in this instance driving from Wanganui would be the best option. 
  For those keen to complete the longer 5 day river journey driving from Taupo to 
  <a href="#Taumarunui" data-audio="audio/speech-taumarunui.mp3" class="audio">Taumarunui</a> is quicker, however this depends on where you hire your canoes. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Flights to these airports typically connect from Auckland and Wellington. The
      above driving times are indicative only - always allow for extra time to get to
      your destination.

    <h4>
      Day 1 and 2: Cherry Grove, Taumaranui to Whakahoro
    </h4>
    <p><strong>
      57km / 35mi</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Travelling the upper reaches of the Whanganui River, you&rsquo;ll pass
      through a mixture of farmland and patches of native bush. A steeper section of the
      river, it features more frequent rapids so enjoy a bit of excitement as you shoot
      down them. You can put your canoe in at <a href="#Ngahuinga" data-audio="audio/speech-ngahuinga.mp3" class="audio">Ngahuinga</a> (Cherry Grove) in Taumarunui or
      further downstream at Ohinepane, accessed from River Road (SH 43). Camp beside the
      murmuring river at Ohinepane, <a href="#Poukaria" data-audio="audio/speech-poukaria.mp3" class="audio">Poukaria</a> or <a href="#Maharanui" data-audio="audio/speech-maharanui.mp3" class="audio">Maharanui</a> Campsites. From here you get
      the feeling of venturing into the heart of a rich and rugged landscape.
    </p>
    
    <h4>
      Day 3: Whakahoro to John Coull Hut
    </h4>
    <p><strong>
      37.5km / 14.5mi</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Below Whakahoro, where many begin their river journey, you&rsquo;ll enter the
      scenic middle reaches of the river. Many begin their journey here. Paddle through
      deep gorges draped in vegetation and often featuring numerous waterfalls after
      heavy rain. Past <a href="#Mangapapa" data-audio="audio/speech-mangapapa.mp3" class="audio">Mangapapa</a> Campsite, take a long loop around the Kirikiriroa
      Peninsula, pass the <a href="#Tarepokioere" data-audio="audio/speech-tarepokioere.mp3" class="audio">Tarepokioere</a> (whirlpool) rapid, which used to pose a danger to
      riverboats, and then the large overhang known as Tamatea&rsquo;s Cave. Please do
      not enter the cave as it is <a href="#wahi tapu" data-audio="audio/speech-wahi_tapu.mp3" class="audio">wahi tapu</a> (a sacred place). Below Ohauora Campsite,
      enter the long <a href="#Otaihanga" data-audio="audio/speech-otaihanga.mp3" class="audio">Otaihanga</a> Reach, which leads you to your overnight stop at John
      Coull Hut and Campsite. If you are lucky you may see long-tailed bats fluttering
      overhead at dusk.
    </p>
    
    <h4>
      Day 4: John Coull Hut to Tieke Kainga
    </h4>
    <p><strong>
      29km / 18mi</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      On this section, follow the river as it meanders through bush-covered hills,
      passing the mouths of the <a href="#Tangarakau" data-audio="audio/speech-tangarakau.mp3" class="audio">Tangarakau</a> and <a href="#Whangamomona" data-audio="audio/speech-whangamomona.mp3" class="audio">Whangamomona</a> Rivers where they join the
      Whanganui. Perched high above the river, <a href="#Mangawaiiti" data-audio="audio/speech-mangawaiiti.mp3" class="audio">Mangawaiiti</a> is an attractive spot to camp
      or stop for lunch. At <a href="#Mangapurua" data-audio="audio/speech-mangapurua.mp3" class="audio">Mangapurua</a> Landing, where the old riverboats used to tie up,
      hop out of your canoe and take a 40 minute bush walk to the historic Bridge to
      Nowhere, a poignant reminder of the Mangapurua Valley farm settlement, carved out
      of the bush and then abandoned between the two World Wars. Look out for cyclists -
      the track is also part of the Mountains to Sea Cycle Trail. Back in your canoe,
      continue your trip downstream to <a href="#Tieke Kainga" data-audio="audio/speech-tieke_kainga.mp3" class="audio">Tieke Kainga</a> where you can examine the intricately
      carved pou whenua and learn about the history of Tieke and the <a href="#tikanga" data-audio="audio/speech-tikanga.mp3" class="audio">tikanga</a> (protocol)
      of the marae.
    </p>
    
    <h4>
      Day 5: Tieke Kainga to Pipiriki
    </h4>
    <p><strong>
      21.5km / 8.3mi</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the homeward stretch, but the river still has a few surprises. You
      can explore the scenic gorge of the <a href="#Manganui o te Ao" data-audio="audio/speech-manganui_o_te_ao.mp3" class="audio">Manganui o te Ao</a> River where it enters the
      Whanganui after its journey from the slopes of Mount Ruapehu. The standing waves of
      the large <a href="#Ngaporo" data-audio="audio/speech-ngaporo.mp3" class="audio">Ngaporo</a> and <a href="#Autapu" data-audio="audio/speech-autapu.mp3" class="audio">Autapu</a> rapids can also provide plenty of excitement and
      perhaps a cool dip on a hot day! More exotic trees and farmland indicate
      you&rsquo;re getting close to Pipiriki and the end of your time on the <a href="#awa" data-audio="audio/speech-awa.mp3" class="audio">awa</a>. Pass an
      eel weir on your left, shoot the <a href="#Paparoa" data-audio="audio/speech-paparoa.mp3" class="audio">Paparoa</a> rapid and you will see the boat ramp below
      Pipiriki village up ahead.
