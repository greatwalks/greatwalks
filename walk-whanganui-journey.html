      The Whanganui River winds its way from the mountains to the Tasman Sea

      <li>
        Visit the famous Bridge to Nowhere, a bridge left behind by returned World
        War One Serviceman in the valley of abandoned dreams. A gentle 40 minute walk
        from the Mangapurua Landing on the Whanganui river will take you there.
      </li>
      <li>
        Listen for the call of the brown kiwi, often heard at night. If
        you&rsquo;re lucky, you may see long-tailed or short-tailed bats fluttering
        overhead at dusk. Look out for the blue duck / whio in the clean fast-flowing
        river habitats, with eels, freshwater crayfish, black flounder and native fish
        species inhabiting the river.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enjoy a unique stay at Tieke Kainga, a Great Walks hut that is also used as
        a marae. Tieke was one of many old pa sites on the Whanganui River and has been
        revived as a kainga (village).
      </li>
      <li>
        Soak up the M&#257;ori history as you journey through this otherwise remote area
        by canoe down the Whanganui River. Discover how M&#257;ori cultivated the sheltered
        river terraces and built elaborate eel traps along the river to feed their
        tribe.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take the shorter, scenic 3 day river journey from Whakahoro to Pipiriki.
        Paddle through deep gorges and pass cascading waterfalls, the Tarepokioere
        (whirlpool) rapid and the large overhang known as Tamatea&rsquo;s Cave.

    <p>
      It is important&nbsp;to plan and prepare
      so that you are well equipped to enjoy your Whanganui Journey.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Before you go, know The<span class=
      "c7">Outdoor Safety Code - 5 simple rules to help you stay
      safe:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        Plan your trip
      </li>
      <li>
        Tell someone
      </li>
      <li>
        Be aware of the weather
      </li>
      <li>
        Know your limits
      </li>
      <li>
        Take sufficient supplies

    <h3>
      Whanganui Journey safety
    </h3>
    <ol class="c12" start="1">
      <li>
        Heavy rain and flooding can occur at any time of year on the Whanganui
        River and the weather can change quickly, so you&rsquo;ll need to be prepared for
        rain, cold and windy conditions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don&rsquo;t canoe the river when water levels are predicted to rise or
        it&rsquo;s in flood. If you capsize you may not be able to get back in, or swim
        to the river&rsquo;s edge.
      </li>
      <li>
        Always pull your canoe up high on the bank and tie it to something secure.
        It may not be raining on the river, but rain elsewhere in the large catchment can
        cause the river to rise several metres overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cell phone coverage on the Whanganui Journey is limited.

      When to go

      most popular time to paddle down the river is during the summer months (December -
      February) when the weather is warmer and the days are longer. There are also many
      other recreational opportunities available in Whanganui National Park to enjoy
      including swimming, rafting, camping and fishing.

    <p>
      Wanganui and Taupo Airports are about the same driving distance from the
      start of the shorter 3 day river journey in Whakahoro, approximately 2.5 hours.
      Canoe hire, drop off and secure parking are packaged together by tour operators.
      Some tour operators are based in Raetihi and Ohakune and in this instance driving
      from Wanganui would be the best option. For those keen to complete the longer 5 day
      river journey driving from Taupo to Taumarunui is quicker, however this depends on
      where you hire your canoes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Flights to these airports typically connect from Auckland and Wellington. The
      above driving times are indicative only - always allow for extra time to get to
      your destination.

      Traditional entry or exit points for journeys on the river are Taumaruni,
      Ohinepane, Whakahoro and Pipiriki. Most facilities and services that cater for
      river travellers are found in Taumarunui and Whanganui, although some facilities
      are found at Raetihi and Ohakune. Accommodation is available in the local

      The river journey from Taumaranui to Pipiriki takes 5 days to complete by
      canoe (145km / 90mi ) or a shorter 3 day journey from Whakahoro to Pipiriki is also
      possible (83km / 52mi ).

      Day 1 and 2: Cherry Grove, Taumaranui to Whakahoro
    </p>
    <p>
      57km / 35mi 
    </p>
    <p>
      Travelling the upper reaches of the Whanganui River, you&rsquo;ll pass
      through a mixture of farmland and patches of native bush. A steeper section of the
      river, it features more frequent rapids so enjoy a bit of excitement as you shoot
      down them. You can put your canoe in at Ngahuinga (Cherry Grove) in Taumarunui or
      further downstream at Ohinepane, accessed from River Road (SH 43). Camp beside the
      murmuring river at Ohinepane, Poukaria or Maharanui Campsites. From here you get
      the feeling of venturing into the heart of a rich and rugged landscape.

      Day 3: Whakahoro to John Coull Hut
    </p>
    <p>
      37.5km / 14.5mi 
    </p>
    <p>
      Below Whakahoro, where many begin their river journey, you&rsquo;ll enter the
      scenic middle reaches of the river. Many begin their journey here. Paddle through
      deep gorges draped in vegetation and often featuring numerous waterfalls after
      heavy rain. Past Mangapapa Campsite, take a long loop around the Kirikiriroa
      Peninsula, pass the Tarepokioere (whirlpool) rapid, which used to pose a danger to
      riverboats, and then the large overhang known as Tamatea&rsquo;s Cave. Please do
      not enter the cave as it is wahi tapu (a sacred place). Below Ohauora Campsite,
      enter the long Otaihanga Reach, which leads you to your overnight stop at John
      Coull Hut and Campsite. If you are lucky you may see long-tailed bats fluttering
      overhead at dusk.

      Day 4: John Coull Hut to Tieke Kainga
    </p>
    <p>
      29km / 18mi 
    </p>
    <p>
      On this section, follow the river as it meanders through bush-covered hills,
      passing the mouths of the Tangarakau and Whangamomona Rivers where they join the
      Whanganui. Perched high above the river, Mangawaiiti is an attractive spot to camp
      or stop for lunch. At Mangapurua Landing, where the old riverboats used to tie up,
      hop out of your canoe and take a 40 minute bush walk to the historic Bridge to
      Nowhere, a poignant reminder of the Mangapurua Valley farm settlement, carved out
      of the bush and then abandoned between the two World Wars. Look out for cyclists -
      the track is also part of the Mountains to Sea Cycle Trail. Back in your canoe,
      continue your trip downstream to Tieke Kainga where you can examine the intricately
      carved pou whenua and learn about the history of Tieke and the tikanga (protocol)
      of the marae.
    </p>

      Day 5: Tieke Kainga to Pipiriki
    </p>
    <p>
      21.5km / 8.3mi 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the homeward stretch, but the river still has a few surprises. You
      can explore the scenic gorge of the Manganui o te Ao River where it enters the
      Whanganui after its journey from the slopes of Mount Ruapehu. The standing waves of
      the large Ngaporo and Autapu rapids can also provide plenty of excitement and
      perhaps a cool dip on a hot day! More exotic trees and farmland indicate
      you&rsquo;re getting close to Pipiriki and the end of your time on the awa. Pass an
      eel weir on your left, shoot the Paparoa rapid and you will see the boat ramp below
      Pipiriki village up ahead.
