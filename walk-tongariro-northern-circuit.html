    <p>
      Winding its way over Mt Tongariro and around Mt Ngauruhoe, this walk passes
      through unique and stunning landforms including active volcanic craters, brilliant
      blue lakes, steaming geothermal areas, and glacial valleys. From alpine herb fields
      to forests, from tranquil lakes to desert-like plateau, this walk is a place of
      extremes and surprises.

        Explore a Natural and Cultural World Heritage Area. Established in 1887,
        Tongariro is New Zealand&rsquo;s first national park and the first national park
        in the world to be gifted by a country's indigenous people.
      </li>
      <li>
        Walk across active volcanoes! The three volcanoes at the heart of the park
        are - Tongariro, Ngauruhoe and Ruapehu, the highest point in the North
        Island.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tama Lakes, named after the high chief Tamatea, explored the area six
        centuries ago. Take a detour off the main track to see these stunning lakes and
        enjoy the views.

      <li>
        Journey to Middle Earth. Tongariro National Park provided the stunning
        backdrop for several filming locations for the Lord of the Rings trilogy
        including Ithilien, Mordor and the Gates of Mordor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tumbling 20 m over the edge of a large lava flow, which erupted from
        Ruapehu 15,000 years ago, Taranaki Falls plunge into a boulder-ringed pool. Allow
        2 hours for the return trip on the loop track.

      and most popular time of year to walk this track is during the summer months
      (December - March) when the tracks are normally clear of snow and the weather is
      less severe.

      Travelling with

    </h3>
    <p>
      The circuit is a moderately challenging hike, mostly on open and exposed
      volcanic terrain and is not recommended for children under the age of 10. However,
      there are a range of shorter walking opportunities, suitable for the whole family
      and for those with less time available. You can do a walk of a few hours or a whole
      day, or an overnight stay in one of the huts or campsites.

    <p>
      The Tongariro Northern Circuit starts and finishes at Whakapapa Village,
      State Highway 48, Mount Ruapehu. You can walk the track in either direction - but
      normally you start at Mangatepopo, as the altitude (1120 m) is higher than at
      Ketetahi (760 m) so there is less climbing involved. Shuttle buses operate for
      walking in this direction, with services to Mangatepopo in the morning and back
      from Ketetahi in the afternoon. Allow an extra hour to walk the track in reverse
      from Ketetahi to Mangatepopo.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Begin 100 m below the Whakapapa Visitor Centre and head along the Taranaki
      Falls track where after 20 mins you can choose to take a detour to the falls.
      Heavily eroded in some places, this track crosses many stream beds. Through here
      you can view the Pukekaikiore vent and the Pukeonake scoria cone, both of which
      were present during the last ice age.

      Mangatepopo Hut to Emerald Lakes
    </p>
    <p>
      3.5 hours, 8km / 5mi 
    </p>
    <p>
      Follow Mangatepopo stream up the valley and across a number of lava flows
      from Ngauruhoe, the youngest from a 1954 eruption. A five minute detour can take
      you to Soda Springs, where cold springs emerge from an old lava flow. The steep
      climb to the top of Mangatepopo Saddle will reward you with views across the
      valley. Cross the South crater, Red crater and North crater and follow the track
      down towards the Emerald Lakes, where you can see three filled explosion pits,
      brilliantly coloured by the minerals washed down from the thermal area.

    </p>
    <p>
      Cross the central crater and the climb up to the ridge beside Blue Lake,
      which has formed where fresh water fills an old volcano vent. The track continues
      around the North crater where views of Lake Rotoaira and Taupo can be seen. You can
      complete the Tongariro Alpine Crossing here by continuing on past the Ketetahi Hut,
      through tussock land down to the Ketetahi car park.

    </p>
    <p>
      The Emerald Lakes track descends into the Oturere Valley and weaves through
      an endless variety of unusual jagged lava forms. A magical place to visit on a
      misty day. The hut has views of the waterfall from the ridge.

      through a beech clad valley up to the ridge top.

      lower track is a 10 minute walk while the upper lake is up a steep ridge and can
      take 1.5 hours. Whakapapa village is a 2 hour walk from the Tama Lakes
      junction.
