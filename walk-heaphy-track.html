      It is important to plan and prepare
      so that you are well equipped to enjoy your Great Walk.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Before you go, know <strong>The Outdoor Safety Code</strong> - 5 simple rules to help you stay
      safe:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        Plan your trip
      </li>
      <li>
        Tell someone
      </li>
      <li>
        Be aware of the weather
      </li>
      <li>
        Know your limits
      </li>
      <li>
        Take sufficient supplies
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
      Heaphy
      Track safety
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        
          Weather on the Heaphy
          Track is changeable with annual rainfall averaging over 4000 mm. Heavy rain can
          occur with little warning and even small streams are dangerous in flood. Be
          prepared for rain, snow and wind especially on the exposed sections of the
          track.
        
      </li>
      <li>
        
          Most major streams are
          bridged, but at Crayfish (Koura) Point the route can be impassable two hours
          either side of high tide when sea conditions are rough. Ensure you check the
          tide timetable when planning your trip.
        
      </li>
      <li>
        
          Sand flies can be
          present during your walk. It is recommended you take insect repellent.
        
      </li>
      <li>
        During winter, adverse
          weather can change the track significantly. These will be marked by signage and
          warning tape although you may want to check with the <a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/footer-links/contact-us/visitor-centres/#nelson">
          DOC Visitor Centre</a> prior to your
          walk.
        
      </li>
      <li>
        Cell phone coverage on the track is limited.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      Things to know before you
      go
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        
          A good level of fitness
          and the right outdoor clothing and equipment will greatly improve the enjoyment
          of your trip.
        
      </li>
      <li>
        Safety is your
          responsibility - Cell phone coverage is limited and it is recommended that you
          leave your trip details with a trusted contact. Intention forms are available
          at <a href=

      </li>
      <li>
       
 Book your trip well in
          advance including your accommodation, transport and transfers to the start/end
          of the Great Walk.
      </li>
      <li>
 
          Pack all necessary
          equipment, your own food and drinks and any personal items for your trip
          including an extra day's supply of food and water.

    <h3>
      When to go
    </h3>
    <p>
      You can walk the Heaphy Track all year. The most popular period is during the
      summer from Christmas through to Easter (December - April), however walking the track in autumn can be a good option as there are fewer people on the track and the weather is often calm and settled. Mountain biking is being trialled on the Heaphy Track in the winter season only, 1 May to 30 September, until 2013.

    <h3>
      Travelling with
      children
    </h3>
    <p>
      For those with limited time or families with young children we recommend
      completing a day walk or staying overnight at a hut to experience some of the track
      and spend time exploring. A popular two-day, one-night
      trip starting from the western side of the track is from <a href="#Kohaihai" data-audio="audio/speech-kohaihai.mp3" class="audio">Kohaihai</a> to
      Heaphy Hut, returning to Kohaihai. The longest of the Great Walks at 78.4km / 30.3mi, to
      walk the whole of the Heaphy Track you will need to be fit and have good equipment.
      We recommend that walkers start a fitness programme at least two months before
      departure and practise carrying a full pack (15kg / 33lbs) up and down stairs or hills.
      For a 4 day trip you can expect to walk up to 24km / 15mi per day or 21km / 13mi per day for a
      5 day trip.

      Elevation profile
    </h3>
    <p>
      From Brown Hut to Aorere Shelter the track climbs gradually. From here, the
      Aorere valley is seen extending northwards and on clear days it is possible to see
      Mt <a href="#Taranaki" data-audio="audio/speech-taranaki.mp3" class="audio">Taranaki</a> / Egmont. 30 mins before reaching Perry Saddle Hut, 880m / 2887ft above sea
      level, a short track leads to a viewpoint at Flanagans Corner. At 915m / 3002ft above sea
      level, this is the highest point on the track.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The track is suitable for walkers with moderate fitness and is mostly
      well-formed but some sections may be steep, rough or muddy. The track is well
      sign-posted and major stream and river crossings are bridged. Note the altitude
      when you view the elevation profile.

    <h3>Walking guide</h3>
    
    <h4>
      Day 1: Brown Hut to Perry Saddle Hut
    </h4>
    <p><strong>
      5 hours, 17.5km / 6.8mi</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Climbing gradually, here you will follow a route once surveyed for a road.
      Perry Hut Saddle is 880m / 2887ft above sea level. Near the hut in Gorge Creek is a deep
      and cold pool, popular for swimming.
    </p>
    
    <h4>
      Day 2: Perry Saddle Hut to Gouland Downs Hut
    </h4>
    <p><strong>
      2 hours, 7km / 4mi</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing through tussock clearings and patches of beech trees this track
      crosses one of several limestone arches which are the remnants of old caves.
    </p>
    
    <h4>
      Day 3: Gouland Downs Hut to Saxon Hut
    </h4>
    <p><strong>
      1.5 hours, 5.4km / 2.1mi</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Relatively level as it crosses the northern part of Gouland Downs, the
      tussock country and riverbeds make it great for exploring. Be careful when the mist
      lowers as the features can be confusing and it is easy to become
      disoriented.
    </p>
    
    <h4>
      Day 4: Saxon Hut to James Mackay Hut
    </h4>
    <p><strong>
      3 hours, 11.8km / 4.6mi</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Dropping slightly to grassy flats beside the Saxton River, a section of this
      track can flood. In wet conditions this can be potentially dangerous, and
      walkers should wait for the water to recede before continuing.
    </p>
    
    <h4>
      Day 5: James Mackay Hut to Lewis Hut
    </h4>
    <p><strong>
      3.5 hours, 12.5km / 4.8mi</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The track soon leads into the richer and taller forest typical of the West
      Coast. Glimpses of the Heaphy River can be spotted along the way. Be sure to apply
      the insect repellent as this is where the sand flies start to appear!
    </p>
    
    <h4>
      Day 6: Lewis Hut to Kohaihai
    </h4>
    <p><strong>
      7.5 hours, 24.2km / 9.3mi</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The track crosses the Heaphy River and continues through a forest of native
      <a href="#kahikatea" data-audio="audio/speech-kahikatea.mp3" class="audio">kahikatea</a>, <a href="#rimu" data-audio="audio/speech-rimu.mp3" class="audio">rimu</a> and <a href="#rata" data-audio="audio/speech-rata.mp3" class="audio">rata</a>. Be sure to listen out for the wildlife. The river mouth
      is at the junction of two pounamu (greenstone) trails with archaeological evidence
      that occupation from <a href="#Maori" data-audio="audio/speech-maori.mp3" class="audio">M&#257;ori</a> extends back 500 years. At the Heaphy River mouth the
      river surges out through a narrow gap into the sea; the churning of fresh water
      with the sea water is spectacular! Crossing at Crayfish (Koura) Point can be
      impassable two hours either side of the high tide mark when conditions are rough.
      Check the tide timetable before you leave the hut.
