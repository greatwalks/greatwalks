        Get on your bike! Until September 2013 you can mountain bike the Heaphy
        Track, it takes 2 - 3 days to ride. Riding from Aorere
        to Karamea is the most popular route.

      <li>
        Kahurangi National Park harbours half of New Zealand&rsquo;s 40
        species of carnivorous land snail (Powelliphanta). Look out for one on the track,
        particularly near limestone outcrops where there is enough calcium to nourish
        their sizeable shells!

        The Heaphy Hut is located right next to one of New

        Kahurangi National Park is home to an abundance of native

      <li>
        
          Weather on the Heaphy
          Track is changeable with annual rainfall averaging over 4000 mm. Heavy rain can
          occur with little warning and even small streams are dangerous in flood. Be
          prepared for rain, snow and wind especially on the exposed sections of the
          track.
        
      </li>
      <li>
        
          Most major streams are
          bridged, but at Crayfish (Koura) Point the route can be impassable two hours
          either side of high tide when sea conditions are rough. Ensure you check the
          tide timetable when planning your trip.

    <h4>
      When to go
    </h4>
    <p>
      You can walk the Heaphy Track all year. The most popular period is during the
      summer from Christmas through to Easter (December - April), however walking the
      track in autumn can be good option as there are fewer people on the track and the
      weather is often calm and settled. Mountain biking is permitted on the Heaphy Track
      during the off peak season only, from 1 May to 30 September, until 30 September
      2013.

    <h4>
      Travelling with
      children
    </h4>
    <p>
      For those with limited time or families with young children we recommend
      completing a day walk or staying overnight at a hut to experience some of the track
      and spend time exploring. A popular2 day, 1 night
      trip starting from the western side of the track is from Kohaihai to
      Heaphy Hut, returning to Kohaihai. The longest of the Great Walks at 78.4km / 30.3mi , to
      walk the whole of the Heaphy Track you will need to be fit and have good equipment.
      We recommend that walkers start a fitness programme at least two months before
      departure and practise carrying a full pack (15kg / 33lbs ) up and down stairs or hills.
      For a 4 day trip you can expect to walk up to 24km / 15mi  per day or 21km / 13mi  per day for a
      5 day trip.

      Track description
    </h4>
    <p>
      You can start the track from the eastern or western end - either from Brown
      Hut, Golden Bay or from Kohaihai, West Coast. This track is not a circuit &ndash;
      the beginning and end of the track are 463km / 288mi  apart by road. Bus and taxi
      services are available to reach either end of the track from nearby towns. The
      track takes 4-6 days to walk, and 2-3 days to mountain bike.

      Elevation profile
    </p>
    <p>
      From Brown Hut to Aorere Shelter the track climbs gradually. From here, the
      Aorere valley is seen extending northwards and on clear days it is possible to see
      Mt Taranaki / Egmont. 30 mins before reaching Perry Saddle Hut, 880 m above sea
      level, a short track leads to a viewpoint at Flanagans Corner. At 915 m above sea
      level, this is the highest point on the track.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The track is suitable for walkers with moderate fitness and is mostly
      well-formed but some sections may be steep, rough or muddy. The track is well
      sign-posted and major stream and river crossings are bridged. Note the altitude
      when you view the elevation profile.

      Day 1: Brown Hut to Perry Saddle Hut
    </p>
    <p>
      5 hours, 17.5km / 6.8mi 
    </p>
    <p>
      Climbing gradually, here you will follow a route once surveyed for a road.
      Perry Hut Saddle is 880m / 2887ft  above sea level. Near the hut in Gorge Creek is a deep
      and cold pool, popular for swimming.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Day 2: Perry Saddle Hut to Gouland Downs Hut
    </p>
    <p>
      2 hours, 7km / 4mi 
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing through tussock clearings and patches of beech trees this track
      crosses one of several limestone arches which are the remnants of old caves.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Day 3: Gouland Downs Hut to Saxon Hut
    </p>
    <p>
      1.5 hours, 5.4km / 2.1mi 
    </p>
    <p>
      Relatively level as it crosses the northern part of Gouland Downs, the
      tussock country and riverbeds make it great for exploring. Be careful when the mist
      lowers as the features can be confusing and it is easy to become
      disoriented.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Day 4: Saxon Hut to James Mackay Hut
    </p>
    <p>
      3 hours, 11.8km / 4.6mi 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dropping slightly to grassy flats beside the Saxton River, a section of this
      track can flood. In wet conditions this can be potentially dangerous, and
      walkers should wait for the water to recede before continuing.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Day 5: James Mackay Hut to Lewis Hut
    </p>
    <p>
      3.5 hours, 12.5km / 4.8mi 
    </p>
    <p>
      The track soon leads into the richer and taller forest typical of the West
      Coast. Glimpses of the Heaphy River can be spotted along the way. Be sure to apply
      the insect repellent as this is where the sand flies start to appear!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Day 6: Lewis Hut to Kohaihai
    </p>
    <p>
      7.5 hours, 24.2km / 9.3mi 
    </p>
    <p>
      The track crosses the Heaphy River and continues through a forest of native
      kahikatea, rimu and rata. Be sure to listen out for the wildlife. The river mouth
      is at the junction of two pounamu (greenstone) trails with archaeological evidence
      that occupation from M&#257;ori extends back 500 years. At the Heaphy River mouth the
      river surges out through a narrow gap into the sea; the churning of fresh water
      with the sea water is spectacular! Crossing at Crayfish (Koura) Point can be
      impassable two hours either side of the high tide mark when conditions are rough.
      Check the tide timetable before you leave the hut.
