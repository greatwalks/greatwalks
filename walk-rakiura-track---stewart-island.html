Glorious tranquility is only a short boat ride or even shorter flight away. 
This is the ultimate island wilderness experience and a taste of the way New Zealand 
used to be. You’ll be welcomed by a cacophony of native birdsong and a warm greeting 
from the locals in the tiny settlement of Oban.
      </li>
      <li>
        From this year-round accessible track, you can enjoy exhilarating cliff-top
        walking between Lee Bay and Port William with fabulous vistas of the
        island&rsquo;s gorgeous golden beaches and rugged coastline, and the protected
        bays of Paterson Inlet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Into history? Then you&rsquo;ll find plenty here from early Māori settlement
        sites around Māori beach and Port William and the abandoned Shetland
        Islanders&rsquo; settlement to old log haulers and other relics from the
        sawmilling days dispersed along the track.

        The amazing Stewart Island Rakiura Tokoeka/Kiwi (unlike their cousins
        further north) can sometimes be seen foraging during daylight hours near the
        North Arm hut and campsite and can be heard calling at day&rsquo;s end.

      <li>
        Ulva Island, a predator-free island sanctuary, is just a short 5 minute
        water taxi ride from Oban, the island&rsquo;s only township. Explore this island
        paradise, home to many rare and endangered native birds.

      It is important to plan and prepare
      so that you are well equipped to enjoy your Great Walk.
    </p>
     
<p>
      Before you go, know <strong>The Outdoor Safety Code</strong> - 5 simple rules to help you stay

      </li>

          Cell phone coverage is
          limited on the track. Telecom provides the only cell phone coverage on Stewart
          Island/Rakiura.

    <h4>Halfmoon Bay to Port William Hut
    </h4>
    <p><strong>4-5 hours, 12km / 7mi </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Step through the chain link sculpture commissioned to recognise the forming
      of the Rakiura National Park, to start your island adventure. Enjoy stunning
      coastal views as the track makes its way from Lee Bay to picturesque Little River,
      which is crossed by bridge. Rounding the tip of Peters Point brings you to M&#257;ori
      Beach, once home to several sawmills and a school. An old boiler is all that
      remains of a once thriving sawmilling community. From here it is a sweeping beach
      walk to the swing bridge before climbing up the forested ridge and dropping down
      into Magnetic Beach and Port William Hut at the far end.
    </p>
     
    <h4>
    Port William Hut to North Arm Hut
    </h4>
    <p><strong>
    6 hours, 13km / 8mi </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Make your way through regenerating podocarp forest and then dense bush as you
      leave the east coast behind you. Take a breather at the old log haulers that used
      to drag the forest giants out of the gullies and hillsides, travel down the
      tramlines which both show remnants of a bygone world, and reflect on the hardy
      settlers who worked the saws to retain a livelihood.
    </p>
     
    <h4>
    North Arm Hut to Halfmoon Bay
    </h4>
    <p><strong>
   4-5 hours, 12km / 7mi </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      From here it&rsquo;s a moderate and undulating walk in the forest fringe
      consisting of k&#257;mahi and rimu surrounded by stunning views across Paterson
      Inlet/Whaka a Te Wera. Follow the coast down to secluded bays, watch the birds
      wading at low tide in Sawdust Bay and then on to Kaipipi Bay where a small grassy
      knoll on the water&rsquo;s edge allows a great perspective over the sheltered
      waterway.
