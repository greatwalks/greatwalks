  <h1>Kepler Track</h1>

  <p>60km / 37mi </p>

  <p>3-4 days</p>

  <p>A real adventure above the clouds, from the gentle, beech-forested
  shores of lakes Te Anau and Manapouri to the tussocky alpine tops and grand Mt Luxmore.
  On top of the world, you&rsquo;ll be rewarded with marvellous panoramic views of the
  Kepler Mountains on one side, and lakes, rivers and valleys on the other.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Explore an amazing limestone cave! Grab a couple of torches
    and take a 10 min stroll from Luxmore Hut to Luxmore Caves. Just 30m / 98ft  into the
    cave you&rsquo;ll find stalactites and stalagmites.</li>

    <li>Swing bridges make for an entertaining journey over rivers
    and creeks. The Rainbow Reach swing bridge crosses the Waiau River and is an
    impressive entry/exit point for the track.</li>

    <li>Take a 15 min stroll from Iris Burn Hut to Iris Burn Falls.
    The falls are a great place for an icy cold swim to refresh you after a day&rsquo;s
    walking!</li>

    <li>Watching the sunrise from Luxmore Hut allows you to take in
    splendid views of Lake Te Anau right across to the Murchison Mountains.</li>

    <li>Listen out for the call of NZ&rsquo;s iconic kiwi from Iris
    Burn Hut. Fiordland Kiwi/Tokoeka can be heard on the Kepler Track. Largely nocturnal,
    it cannot fly, has loose, hair-like feathers and long whiskers.</li>

  <h2>Before you go</h2>

  <p>It is important to plan
  and prepare so that you will be well equipped to enjoy your Great Walk.</p>

   

  <p>Before you go, know The Outdoor Safety Code - 5 simple rules to help you stay safe:</p>

   

  <ol>
    <li>Plan your trip</li>

    <li>Tell someone</li>

    <li>Be aware of the weather</li>

    <li>Know your limits</li>

    <li>Take sufficient supplies</li>
  </ol>

   

   

   

  <h4>Kepler Track safety</h3>

  <ol >
    <li>
      This track is not
      recommended for children under the age of 10 due to the exposed mountainous
      environment and often adverse weather conditions. However, an overnight stay at
      Moturau Hut is a great way for the whole family to experience part of this
      track.
    </li>

    <li>
      The track may need to be
      closed for safety reasons (e.g. avalanche danger, flooding or high winds). DOC
      staff can keep you informed of all issues and options around these
      situations.
    </li>

    <li>
      During the off-peak
      season (May - October) the track remains open but is subject to weather, track and
      avalanche conditions. Make sure you are fully prepared before you go. There are no
      hut wardens during the off-peak season.
    </li>

    <li>
      Fiordland National Park
      lies in an area of predominantly westerly airstreams, which delivers high rainfall
      and changeable weather patterns to the area. Cold temperatures, snow, strong winds
      and heavy rain can occur at any time of the year. Contact the
      Fiordland National Park Visitor Centre for current weather,
      track and avalanche conditions before departing.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <ol>
    <li>There is a risk of Giardia. Boil, filter or chemically treat
    water if you doubt its purity.</li>

    <li>Cell phone coverage on the track is limited.</li>
  </ol>

   

  <h4>Things to know before you go</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>
      A good level of fitness
      and the right outdoor clothing and equipment will greatly improve the enjoyment of
      your trip.
    </li>

    <li>
      Safety is your
      responsibility - cell phone coverage is limited and it is recommended that you
      leave your trip details with a trusted contact. Intention forms are available
      at <a 
      href=
      "http://adventuresmart.org.nz/Outdoors-Intentions/Default.asp">adventuresmart.org.nz</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
      Book your trip well in
      advance including your accommodation, transport and transfers to the start/end of
      the Great Walk.
    </li>

    <li>
      Pack all necessary
      equipment, your own food and drinks and any personal items for your trip including
      an extra day's supply of food and water.
    </li>

    <li>

      equipment and preparation required for this walk, plus track updates for the Kepler
      Track, please visit<a href=

    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4>When to go</h3>

  <p>The best time to walk the Kepler Track is during the Great Walks
  season from late October to late April when the weather is warmer and there are more
  regular transport services to and from the start and end of the track. During the
  off-peak season (May to October) the Kepler Track remains open but is subject to
  weather, track and avalanche conditions.</p>

    <li>Food, incl. high-energy food</li>

  <h2>On the  track</h2>

  <h4>Track description</h3>

  <p>The Kepler Track is a circular track that begins and ends at the
  Kepler Track carpark at the southern end of Lake Te Anau, about 5km / 3mi  from Te Anau
  township. This well-graded track can be walked in either direction.</p>

   

  <p>Access is either by road or a 50 minute walk from the Fiordland
  National Park Visitor Centre. Alternatively, there is an entry point at Rainbow Reach,
  a 10 minute (12km / 7mi ) drive from Te Anau.</p>

   

  <p>Shuttle buses provide a daily service to entry and exit points on
  the track during the Great Walks season (late October to late April). A scheduled boat
  service also offers transport to Brod Bay.</p>

  

  <p>View map.</p>

  <h4>Elevation profile</h3>

  <p>It is recommended that the track is walked in an anti-clockwise
  direction, allowing a more gradual climb of 1000m through cool beech forest to the bush
  line. Note the altitude level when you view the elevation profile.</p>

  <p>Day 1: Kepler Track car park to Luxmore Hut</p>

  <p>5-6 hours, 13.8km / 5.3mi  / 8 mi</p>

  <p>Walk alongside the lake shore through a forest of mountain and red
  beech, a grove of hard tree ferns and crown fern. Continue through to Coal Creek Bridge
  to arrive at Brod Bay which is a great spot for swimming. Climbing steadily for two hours, the track will lead you to
  limestone bluffs and a great place to lunch. Another hour&rsquo;s walking will reward
  you with panoramic views of the Te Anau Basin and the Takitimu, Snowden and Earl
  Mountains.</p>

   

  <p>Luxmore Hut to Iris Burn Hut</p>

  <p>5-6 hours, 14.6km / 5.6mi </p>

  <p>In heavy rain, strong winds or wintry weather wait at Luxmore Hut
  until the weather improves. From the hut, a gradual climb will take you to a ridge
  below the summit of Mount Luxmore and a side track walk of 10 minutes will take you to
  the 1472 m summit. After a climb over ridges for about 2 hours, the track starts to
  wind down through beautiful forest. A 20 minute walk from the Iris Burn Hut will lead
  you to Iris Burns Waterfall.</p>

   

  <p>Iris Burn Hut to Moturau Hut</p>

  <p>5-6 hours, 16.2km / 6.3mi </p>

  <p>Walk through beech forest and a gorge, climb over a low saddle and
  wander through another mixed species forest on your way to a large natural landslide,
  which was caused by excessive rain in 1984. As you near Lake Manapouri a left turn
  takes you through lowland beech and a podocarp forest through to Moturau Hut which is
  situated beside a beautiful beach.</p>

      

   

  <p>Moturau Hut to Kepler Track car park</p>

  <p>4-5 hours, 15.5km / 6mi </p>

  <p>A moderate walk will take you through a beech forest across
  wetland, follows the Waiau River Terrace to the swing bridge at Rainbow Reach. Follow
  the final part of the Kepler Track through a variety of forest and river views through
  to the Kepler Track car park. Along here are great opportunities for trout
  fishing!</p>
